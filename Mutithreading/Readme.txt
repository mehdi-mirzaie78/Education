# Intro
# Basics
Each process contains 1 or more threads
Thread is the smallest unit for process

In a simple way:
	Threads are parts of a Process
	
------------------------------------------------
# CPU BOUND: The work is bound to CPU (Multi Processing)

# I/O BOUND: The work is bound to Input and Output(Multi Threading)

Synchronous: 	Things will be executed one by one
Asynchronous: 	Things will be executed in parallel

With Python, we can't really do multithread it pretends to be doing multithreading but in reality, it just pretends

If we really want to do multithreading we should use GO for programming
